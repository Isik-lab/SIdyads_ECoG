# SIdyads_ECoG
 
## `SIdyads_loopit.m`
This is primarily a wrapping and looping function that calls the practice (if enabled) and the main experiment. No inputs are required, but if none are set, the `subj_number` is set to 77, there will not be practice, and no responses will be recorded by default.

## `SIdyads_practice.m`
This calls the practice code. Random videos are selected to be presented. The participant must reach the input threshold accuracy to be able to progress. The ISI for the practice is 1.5 times as long as for the main experiment.

## `SIdyads.m`
This is the main experiment that presents the stimuli. Breaks are enabled between the long presentation of videos with a frequency determined by the `break_frequency` input parameter. If `RTbox_connected` is set to 1, the code will attempt to connect both to the RTBox and DAQ. 

## social_dyad_videos_500ms/
To run the experiment, the "social_dyad_videos_500ms/" directory must be added to the main folder. The directory can be downloaded from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-EGqd_Yp0yKg5ooeS0ujAVnPmdAlXAsC?usp=sharing).
